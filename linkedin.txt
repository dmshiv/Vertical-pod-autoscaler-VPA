Here’s a LinkedIn post you can use for your VPA demo:

🚀 Exploring Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)!

After working with HPA, I wanted to see how VPA can optimize resource usage for my workloads. Here’s what I learned:

🔹 What is VPA?
VPA automatically adjusts CPU and memory requests for your containers based on real usage. Instead of adding more pods (like HPA), it makes each pod “bigger or smaller” as needed.

🔹 How does it work?

Recommender: Watches your pods and suggests the best CPU/memory.
Admission Controller: Injects those recommendations into new pods.
Updater: Evicts pods if their resources are way off, so they restart with better values.
🔹 Key Takeaways:

VPA ignores resource limits in your deployment YAML! If you want to set boundaries, use maxAllowed and minAllowed in your VPA YAML.
Great for stable workloads where right-sizing is more important than scaling out.
🔹 When to use VPA vs HPA?

Use VPA for optimizing pod resources.
Use HPA for scaling the number of pods.
Combine both for the best of both worlds!
Check out my repo for a hands-on demo, troubleshooting tips, and diagrams that make VPA super easy to understand.
